It often trips up programmers with deep experience in other languages when they try their hand at client or server-side JavaScript. But, asynchronous JavaScript isn’t as hard as it seems once you learn a few simple rules about how it works. In this talk, we’ll dive into the mechanics of concepts that you might have had a chance to full grok.
Let’s dispel this confusion once and for all. We’ll explore some metaphors that illustrate the difference between how synchronous and asynchronous code execute. We’ll dive into essential concepts like the call stack and the event loop to build a solid conceptual understanding of how the asynchronous model is implemented. Finally, we’ll take a good hard look at a number of common patterns for writing asynchronous code in JavaScript. We’ll start with the listening for events on XMLHttpRequest and build callback and promise APIs on top on it.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Steve is the director of the front-end engineering program at the Turing School for Software and Design.

An accessible web extends opportunities for learning, teaching, working and participating to a larger audience that traditionally faces barriers to access at every turn.
You may be good with accessibility already. Some headings here, some alt attributes there. A good start. But how does that work on accessibility actually change things for people with disabilities? Part of the answer lies in testing sites and applications to identify barriers to access.
Developing accessible applications is a lot easier if you can work some testing into your development workflow without adding loads of time or money to the process. This session will teach you how you can use a few tools and techniques to diagnose lots of barriers to access that your users with disabilities encounter. As you learn about some of the tools, you will also learn more about what makes the web more accessible.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Rob Carr is the Accessibility Coordinator for Oklahoma ABLE Tech, Oklahoma's Assistive Technology Act Program, housed at Oklahoma State University.
